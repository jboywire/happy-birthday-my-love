  <p>My babe is the sweetest mix of everything i love- she`s short enough for me to want to pull her close all the time, yet big enough to fill my whole heart. she has an amazing smile that could outshine the sun, and a laugh that makes me forget every bad. She`s obsessed with chocolate(and i`m obsesed with watching her enjoy it), loves a good gossip session, and somehow manages to be funny without even trying. her favourite color is purple, and just like the color she`s rare, beautiful, and impossible to ignore. even when am sad she always lights up my world. she`s my person, my safe place and my favourite everything.</p>
